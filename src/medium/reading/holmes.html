          <h1>A Case of Identity</h1>
          <p>
            &quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on
            either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, &quot;life
            is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man can
            invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really
            mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
            hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs,
            and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange
            coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful
            chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the
            most <i>outr&eacute;</i> results, it would make all fiction, with
            its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions, most stale and
            unprofitable.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And yet I am not convinced of it,&quot; I answered. &quot;The
            cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough,
            and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
            its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
            neither fascinating nor artistic.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
            realistic effect,&quot; remarked Holmes. &quot;This is wanting in
            the police report, where more stress is laid perhaps upon the
            platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
            observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon
            it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I smiled and shook my head. &quot;I can quite understand your
            thinking so,&quot; I said. &quot;Of course, in your position of
            unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely
            puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact
            with all that is strange and <i>bizarre</i>. But here&quot;&mdash;I
            picked up the morning paper from the ground&mdash;&quot;let us put
            it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come.
            'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print,
            but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to
            me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the
            blow, the bruise, the unsympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest
            of writers could invent nothing more crude.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your
            argument,&quot; said Holmes, taking the paper, and glancing his eye
            down it. &quot;This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it
            happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in
            connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other
            woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into
            the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and
            hurling them at his wife, which you will allow is not an action
            likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller. Take
            a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
            you in your example.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the
            center of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely
            ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Ah!&quot; said he, &quot;I forgot that I had not seen you for
            some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia, in
            return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler
            papers.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And the ring?&quot; I asked, glancing at a remarkable
            brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter
            in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
            even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my
            little problems.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And have you any on hand just now?&quot; I asked with
            interest.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Some ten or twelve, but none which present any features of
            interest. They are important, you understand, without being
            interesting. Indeed I have found that it is usually in unimportant
            matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick
            analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an
            investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the
            bigger the crime, the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In
            these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been
            referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any
            features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have
            something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one
            of my clients, or I am much mistaken.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            He had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted
            blinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.
            Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there
            stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large
            curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a
            coquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear.
          </p>

          <p>
            From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating
            fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and
            forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly,
            with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried
            across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I have seen those symptoms before,&quot; said Holmes, throwing
            his cigarette into the fire. &quot;Oscillation upon the pavement
            always means an <i>affaire de coeur</i>. She would like advice, but
            is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication.
            And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been
            seriously wronged by a man, she no longer oscillates, and the usual
            symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a
            love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed
            or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our
            doubts.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            As he spoke, there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
            entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
            loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchantman
            behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy
            courtesy for which he was remarkable, and having closed the door,
            and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and
            yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Do you not find,&quot; he said, &quot;that with your short
            sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I did at first,&quot; she answered, &quot;but now I know where
            the letters are without looking.&quot; Then, suddenly realizing the
            full purport of his words, she gave a violent start, and looked up
            with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humored face.
            &quot;You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes,&quot; she cried, &quot;else
            how could you know all that?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Never mind,&quot; said Holmes, laughing, &quot;it is my
            business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what
            others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
            whose husband you found so easily when the police and everyone had
            given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much
            for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own
            right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would
            give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?&quot;
            asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger tips together, and his eyes
            to the ceiling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
            Mary Sutherland. &quot;Yes, I did bang out of the house,&quot; she
            said, &quot;for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
            Windibank&mdash;that is, my father&mdash;took it all. He would not
            go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
            would do nothing, and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it
            made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to
            you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your father?&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your stepfather, surely,
            since the name is different.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
            too, for he is only five years and two months older than
            myself.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And your mother is alive?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, yes; mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
            Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a
            man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a
            plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business
            behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but
            when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was
            very superior, being a traveler in wines. They got four thousand
            seven hundred for the good-will and interest, which wasn't near as
            much as father could have got if he had been alive.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling
            and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened
            with the greatest concentration of attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your own little income,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it come out
            of the business?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle
            Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying four and half
            per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
            only touch the interest.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You interest me extremely,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;And since
            you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into
            the bargain, you no doubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in
            every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon
            an income of about sixty pounds.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
            understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
            burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I
            am staying with them. Of course that is only just for the time. Mr.
            Windibank draws my interest every quarter, and pays it over to
            mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at
            typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from
            fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You have made your position very clear to me,&quot; said
            Holmes. &quot;This is my friend, Doctor Watson, before whom you can
            speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
            connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously
            at the fringe of her jacket. &quot;I met him first at the
            gasfitters' ball,&quot; she said. &quot;They used to send father
            tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us,
            and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
            never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted
            so much as to join a Sunday School treat. But this time I was set on
            going, and I would go, for what right had he to prevent? He said the
            folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to
            be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my
            purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At
            last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the
            business of the firm; but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who
            used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer
            Angel.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I suppose,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that when Mr. Windibank
            came back from France, he was very annoyed at your having gone to
            the ball?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember,
            and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
            anything to a woman, for she would have her way.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand,
            a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask
            if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him&mdash;that is
            to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
            came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
            any more.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, you know, father didn't like anything of the sort. He
            wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say
            that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as
            I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with,
            and I had not got mine yet.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
            you?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and
            Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see
            each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
            used to write every day. I took the letters in the morning, so there
            was no need for father to know.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
            we took. Hosmer&mdash;Mr. Angel&mdash;was a cashier in an office in
            Leadenhall Street&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;What office?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes; I don't know.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Where did he live, then?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;He slept on the premises.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And you don't know his address?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No&mdash;except that it was Leadenhall Street.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Where did you address your letters, then?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
            for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
            chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so
            I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have
            that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from
            me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine
            had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me,
            Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It was most suggestive,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It has long
            been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most
            important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer
            Angel?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with
            me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
            be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice
            was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was
            young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat and a
            hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well
            dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine
            are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
            returned to France?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we
            should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest,
            and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
            happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
            right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
            Mother was all in his favor from the first, and was even fonder of
            him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week,
            I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about
            father, but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would
            make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It
            seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years
            older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I
            wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French
            offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the
            wedding.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;It missed him, then?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir, for he had started to England just before it
            arrived.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
            the Friday. Was it to be in church?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's,
            near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the
            St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
            two of us, he put us both into it, and stepped himself into a
            four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street.
            We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we
            waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman
            got down from the box and looked, there was no one there! The cabman
            said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had
            seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes,
            and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any
            light upon what became of him.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It seems to me that you have been very shamefully
            treated,&quot; said Holmes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
            the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be
            true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
            separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and
            that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange
            talk for a wedding morning, but what has happened since gives a
            meaning to it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
            unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
            would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
            happened.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;But you have no notion as to what it could have been?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;One more question. How did your mother take the matter?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the
            matter again.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And your father? Did you tell him?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
            happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what
            interest could anyone have in bringing me to the door of the church,
            and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had
            married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some
            reason; but Hosmer was very independent about money, and never would
            look at a shilling of mine. And yet what could have happened? And
            why could he not write? Oh! it drives me half mad to think of, and I
            can't sleep a wink at night.&quot; She pulled a little handkerchief
            out of her muff, and began to sob heavily into it.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I shall glance into the case for you,&quot; said Holmes,
            rising, &quot;and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite
            result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not
            let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr.
            Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your
            life.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Then you don't think I'll see him again?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I fear not.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then what has happened to him?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
            accurate description of him, and any letters of his which you can
            spare.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I advertised for him in last Saturday's
            <i>Chronicle</i>,&quot; said she. &quot;Here is the slip, and here
            are four letters from him.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Thank you. And your address?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
            father's place of business?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret
            importers of Fenchurch Street.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
            leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
            you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to
            affect your life.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall
            be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
            something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled
            our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table,
            and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be
            summoned.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger tips
            still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and
            his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the
            rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counselor,
            and, having lighted it, he leaned back in his chair, with thick blue
            cloud wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor
            in his face.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Quite an interesting study, that maiden,&quot; he observed.
            &quot;I found her more interesting than her little problem, which,
            by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if
            you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
            the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there
            were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself
            was most instructive.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
            invisible to me,&quot; I remarked.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where
            to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
            you to realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
            thumb nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace.
            Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
            it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
            feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
            sewed upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress
            was brown, rather darker than coffee color, with a little purple
            plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were
            worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe.
            She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of
            being fairly well-to-do, in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going
            way.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You
            have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
            everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you
            have a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my
            boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is
            always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to
            take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush
            upon her sleeve, which is a most useful material for showing traces.
            The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist
            presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing
            machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the
            left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of
            being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at
            her face, and observing the dint of a <i>pince-nez</i> at either
            side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and
            typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;It surprised me.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised
            and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
            which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really
            odd ones, the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other
            a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of
            five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you
            see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from
            home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say
            that she came away in a hurry.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And what else?&quot; I asked, keenly interested, as I always
            was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before
            leaving home, but after being fully dressed. You observed that her
            right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not, apparently,
            see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
            written in a hurry, and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
            this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
            All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to
            business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
            description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I held the little printed slip to the light. &quot;Missing,&quot; it
            said, &quot;on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named
            Hosmer Angel. About five feet seven inches in height; strongly
            built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the center,
            bushy black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted glasses; slight
            infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black
            frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and
            gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided
            boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall
            Street. Anybody bringing,&quot; etc., etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;That will do,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;As to the
            letters,&quot; he continued, glancing over them, &quot;they are very
            commonplace. Absolutely no clew in them to Mr. Angel, save that he
            quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which
            will no doubt strike you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;They are typewritten,&quot; I remarked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
            neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see,
            but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather
            vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive&mdash;in
            fact, we may call it conclusive.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Of what?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
            bears upon the case?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be
            able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
            instituted.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters
            which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
            other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him
            whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It
            is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives.
            And now, doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those
            letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for
            the interim.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of
            reasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he
            must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with
            which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon
            to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the
            King of Bohemia and the Irene Adler photograph, but when I looked
            back to the weird business of the &quot;Sign of the Four,&quot; and
            the extraordinary circumstances connected with the &quot;Study in
            Scarlet,&quot; I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which
            he could not unravel.
          </p>

          <p>
            I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
            conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find
            that he held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the
            identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.
          </p>

          <p>
            A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention
            at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of
            the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found
            myself free, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker
            Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the
            <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the little mystery. I found Sherlock
            Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled
            up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles
            and test-tubes, with the pungent, cleanly smell of hydrochloric
            acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which
            was so dear to him.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Well, have you solved it?&quot; I asked as I entered.</p>

          <p>&quot;Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No, no; the mystery!&quot; I cried.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
            There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
            yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is
            that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
            Sutherland?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
            opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the
            passage, and a tap at the door.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,&quot; said
            Holmes. &quot;He has written to me to say that he would be here at
            six. Come in!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty
            years of age, clean shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,
            insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
            gray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his
            shiny top hat upon the sideboard, and, with a slight bow, sidled
            down into the nearest chair.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Good evening, Mr. James Windibank,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I
            think this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
            appointment with me for six o'clock?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
            quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has
            troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better
            not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my
            wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl,
            as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she
            has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so
            much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is
            not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad.
            Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find
            this Hosmer Angel?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;On the contrary,&quot; said Holmes, quietly, &quot;I have
            every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr.
            Hosmer Angel.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. &quot;I
            am delighted to hear it,&quot; he said.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is a curious thing,&quot; remarked Holmes, &quot;that a
            typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's
            handwriting. Unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly
            alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on
            one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
            in every case there is some little slurring over the <i>e</i>, and a
            slight defect in the tail of the <i>r</i>. There are fourteen other
            characteristics, but those are the more obvious.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
            and no doubt it is a little worn,&quot; our visitor answered,
            glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And now I will show you what is really a very interesting
            study, Mr. Windibank,&quot; Holmes continued. &quot;I think of
            writing another little monograph some of these days on the
            typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I
            have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which
            purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In
            each case, not only are the <i>e</i>'s slurred and the <i>r</i>'s
            tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying
            lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have
            alluded are there as well.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Windibank sprung out of his chair, and picked up his hat.
            &quot;I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr.
            Holmes,&quot; he said. &quot;If you can catch the man, catch him,
            and let me know when you have done it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Holmes, stepping over and turning the
            key in the door. &quot;I let you know, then, that I have caught
            him!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;What! where?&quot; shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his
            lips, and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, it won't do&mdash;really it won't,&quot; said Holmes,
            suavely. &quot;There is no possible getting out of it, Mr.
            Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad
            compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so
            simple a question. That's right! Sit down, and let us talk it
            over.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a
            glitter of moisture on his brow. &quot;It&mdash;it's not
            actionable,&quot; he stammered.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I am very much afraid that it is not; but between ourselves,
            Windibank, it was as cruel, and selfish, and heartless a trick in a
            petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
            course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
            breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on
            the corner of the mantelpiece, and, leaning back with his hands in
            his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to
            us.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
            money,&quot; said he, &quot;and he enjoyed the use of the money of
            the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
            sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
            made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
            The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
            and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her
            fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be
            allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of
            course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do
            to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home,
            and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But
            soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became
            restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her
            positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever
            stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
            than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife,
            he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses
            masked the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk
            that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on
            account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel,
            and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It was only a joke at first,&quot; groaned our visitor.
            &quot;We never thought that she would have been so carried
            away.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
            decidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her
            stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an
            instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's
            attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
            admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was
            obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as if would go, if a
            real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an
            engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from
            turning toward anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up
            forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous.
            The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such
            a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon
            the young lady's mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other
            suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted
            upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of
            something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James
            Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and
            so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any
            rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door
            he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently
            vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
            four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that that was the chain
            of events, Mr. Windibank!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
            had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer
            upon his pale face.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said he;
            &quot;but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to
            know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have
            done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that
            door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and
            illegal constraint.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The law cannot, as you say, touch you,&quot; said Holmes,
            unlocking and throwing open the door, &quot;yet there never was a
            man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or
            a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By
            Jove!&quot; he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter
            sneer upon the man's face, &quot;it is not part of my duties to my
            client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just
            treat myself to&mdash;&quot; He took two swift steps to the whip,
            but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon
            the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could
            see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the
            road.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!&quot; said Holmes, laughing
            as he threw himself down into his chair once more. &quot;That fellow
            will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and
            ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely
            devoid of interest.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your
            reasoning,&quot; I remarked.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
            Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct,
            and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by
            the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the
            fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always
            appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted
            spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise,
            as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his
            peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course,
            inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would
            recognize even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated
            facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
            direction.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And how did you verify them?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.
            I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
            description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the
            result of a disguise,&mdash;the whiskers, the glasses, the
            voice,&mdash;and I sent it to the firm with a request that they
            would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of
            their travelers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
            typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address,
            asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was
            typewritten, and revealed the same trivial but characteristic
            defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse &amp;
            Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in
            every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank.
            <i>Voil&agrave; tout!</i>&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And Miss Sutherland?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the
            old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
            cub, and danger also for whoso snatcheth a delusion from a woman.'
            There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge
            of the world.&quot;

          <p>
            To Sherlock Holmes she is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom
            heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
            and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any
            emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one
            particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
            balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
            observing machine that the world has seen; but as a lover, he would
            have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the
            softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable
            things for the observer&mdash;excellent for drawing the veil from
            men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit
            such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted
            temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw
            a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument,
            or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more
            disturbing that a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet
            there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
            Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
            from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centered
            interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself
            master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my
            attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his
            whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,
            buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week
            between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the
            fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
            attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties
            and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those
            clews, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as
            hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
            vague account of his doings; of his summons to Odessa in the case of
            the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of
            the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
            which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the
            reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity,
            however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily
            press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
          </p>

          <p>
            One night&mdash;it was on the 20th of March, 1888&mdash;I was
            returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
            civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
            passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in
            my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in
            Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to
            know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were
            brilliantly lighted, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare
            figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was
            pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest,
            and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and
            habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work
            again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon
            the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell, and was shown up to
            the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
            think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye,
            he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and
            indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood
            before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective
            fashion.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Wedlock suits you,&quot; he remarked. &quot;I think, Watson,
            that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Seven,&quot; I answered.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle
            more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
            tell me that you intended to go into harness.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Then how do you know?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been
            getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy
            and careless servant girl?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;My dear Holmes,&quot; said I, &quot;this is too much. You
            would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago.
            It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a
            dreadful mess; but as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how
            you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
            given her notice; but there again I fail to see how you work it
            out.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is simplicity itself,&quot; said he, &quot;my eyes tell me
            that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight
            strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.
            Obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly
            scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud
            from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out
            in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant
            boot-slicking specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if
            a gentleman walks into my rooms, smelling of iodoform, with a black
            mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on
            the side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his
            stethoscope, I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be
            an active member of the medical profession.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I could not help laughing at the ease with which he, explained his
            process of deduction. &quot;When I hear you give your reasons,&quot;
            I remarked, &quot;the thing always appears to me so ridiculously
            simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive
            instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your
            process. And yet, I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Quite so,&quot; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and
            throwing himself down into an armchair. &quot;You see, but you do
            not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have
            frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this
            room.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Frequently.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;How often?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Well, some hundreds of times.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then how many are there?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;How many? I don't know.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That
            is just my point. Now, I know there are seventeen steps, because I
            have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in
            these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle
            one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in
            this.&quot; He threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted note paper
            which had been lying open upon the table. &quot;It came by the last
            post,&quot; said he. &quot;Read it aloud.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
            o'clock,&quot; it said, &quot;a gentleman who desires to consult you
            upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to
            one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who
            may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
            can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
            quarters received. Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do
            not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This is indeed a mystery,&quot; I remarked. &quot;What do you
            imagine that it means?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
            one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,
            instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself&mdash;what do
            you deduce from it?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
            written.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,&quot; I
            remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion's processes.
            &quot;Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It
            is peculiarly strong and stiff.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Peculiar&mdash;that is the very word,&quot; said Holmes.
            &quot;It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the
            light&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I did so, and saw a large <i>E</i> with a small <i>g</i>, a
            <i>P</i> and a large <i>G</i> with a small <i>t</i> woven into the
            texture of the paper.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;What do you make of that?&quot; asked Holmes.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram,
            rather.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Not all. The <i>G</i> with the small <i>t</i> stands for
            'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary
            contraction like our 'Co.' <i>P</i>, of course, stands for 'Papier.'
            Now for the <i>Eg</i>. Let us glance at our 'Continental
            Gazetteer.&quot; He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
            &quot;Eglow, Eglonitz&mdash;here we are, Egria. It is in a
            German-speaking country&mdash;in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.
            'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for
            its numerous glass factories and paper mills.' Ha! ha! my boy, what
            do you make of that?&quot; His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great
            blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;The paper was made in Bohemia,&quot; I said.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
            note the peculiar construction of the sentence&mdash;'This account
            of you we have from all quarters received'? A Frenchman or Russian
            could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous
            to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted
            by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a
            mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken,
            to resolve all our doubts.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating
            wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.
            Holmes whistled.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;A pair, by the sound,&quot; said he. &quot;Yes,&quot; he
            continued, glancing out of the window. &quot;A nice little brougham
            and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's
            money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I think I had better go, Holmes.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
            Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to
            miss it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;But your client&mdash;&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
            comes. Sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best
            attention.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in
            the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a
            loud and authoritative tap.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Come in!&quot; said Holmes.</p>

          <p>
            A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
            inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress
            was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as
            akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the
            sleeves and front of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue
            cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with
            flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which
            consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up
            his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,
            completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by
            his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,
            while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past
            the cheek-bones, a black visard mask, which he had apparently
            adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he
            entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of
            strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight
            chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You had my note?&quot; he asked, with a deep, harsh voice and
            a strongly marked German accent. &quot;I told you that I would
            call.&quot; He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain
            which to address.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Pray take a seat,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;This is my friend
            and colleague, Doctor Watson, who is occasionally good enough to
            help me in my cases. Whom have I the honor to address?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You may address me as the Count von Kramm, a Bohemian
            nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of
            honor and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
            extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with
            you alone.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back
            into my chair. &quot;It is both, or none,&quot; said he. &quot;You
            may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to
            me.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The count shrugged his broad shoulders. &quot;Then I must
            begin,&quot; said he, &quot;by binding you both to absolute secrecy
            for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no
            importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such
            weight that it may have an influence upon European history.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I promise,&quot; said Holmes.</p>

          <p>&quot;And I.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;You will excuse this mask,&quot; continued our strange
            visitor. &quot;The august person who employs me wishes his agent to
            be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which
            I have just called myself is not exactly my own.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I was aware of it,&quot; said Holmes, dryly.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
            has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal,
            and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To
            speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein,
            hereditary kings of Bohemia.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I was also aware of that,&quot; murmured Holmes, settling
            himself down in his armchair, and closing his eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
            lounging figure of the man who had been, no doubt, depicted to him
            as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
            Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
            gigantic client.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;If your majesty would condescend to state your case,&quot; he
            remarked, &quot;I should be better able to advise you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The man sprung from his chair, and paced up and down the room in
            uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
            tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You are right,&quot; he cried, &quot;I am the king. Why should
            I attempt to conceal it?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Why, indeed?&quot; murmured Holmes. &quot;Your majesty had not
            spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
            Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
            hereditary King of Bohemia.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;But you can understand,&quot; said our strange visitor,
            sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white
            forehead, &quot;you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing
            such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that
            I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his
            power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of
            consulting you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then, pray consult,&quot; said Holmes, shutting his eyes once
            more.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
            lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
            adventuress Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Kindly look her up in my index, doctor,&quot; murmured Holmes,
            without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system for
            docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was
            difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at
            once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
            sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff
            commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Let me see!&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Hum! Born in New Jersey
            in the year 1858. Contralto&mdash;hum! La Scala&mdash;hum! Prima
            donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw&mdash;yes! Retired from operatic
            stage&mdash;ha! Living in London&mdash;quite so! Your majesty, as I
            understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some
            compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters
            back.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Precisely so. But how&mdash;&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Was there a secret marriage?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No legal papers or certificates?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;None.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then I fail to follow your majesty. If this young person
            should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how
            is she to prove their authenticity?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;There is the writing.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Pooh-pooh! Forgery.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;My private note paper.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Stolen.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;My own seal.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Imitated.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;My photograph.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Bought.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;We were both in the photograph.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, dear! That is very bad. Your majesty has indeed committed
            an indiscretion.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I was mad&mdash;insane.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;You have compromised yourself seriously.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am but thirty
            now.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;It must be recovered.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;We have tried and failed.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Your majesty must pay. It must be bought.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;She will not sell.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Stolen, then.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay
            ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled.
            Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;No sign of it?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Absolutely none.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            Holmes laughed. &quot;It is quite a pretty little problem,&quot;
            said he.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;But a very serious one to me,&quot; returned the king,
            reproachfully.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
            photograph?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;To ruin me.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But how?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I am about to be married.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;So I have heard.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of the
            King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her
            family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a
            doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And Irene Adler?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
            know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of
            steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind
            of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another
            woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
            go&mdash;none.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;You are sure she has not sent it yet?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I am sure.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And why?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Because she has said that she would send it on the day when
            the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next
            Monday.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, then we have three days yet,&quot; said Holmes, with a
            yawn. &quot;That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of
            importance to look into just at present. Your majesty will, of
            course, stay in London for the present?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of
            the Count von Kramm.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we
            progress.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Pray do so; I shall be all anxiety.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then, as to money?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;You have <i>carte blanche</i>.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Absolutely?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my
            kingdom to have that photograph.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And for present expenses?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            The king took a heavy chamois-leather bag from under his cloak, and
            laid it on the table.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;There are three hundred pounds in gold, and seven hundred in
            notes,&quot; he said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook, and handed
            it to him.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And mademoiselle's address?&quot; he asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Holmes took a note of it. &quot;One other question,&quot; said he,
            thoughtfully. &quot;Was the photograph a cabinet?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;It was.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then, good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
            have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,&quot; he added,
            as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. &quot;If
            you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three
            o'clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with
            you.&quot;
          </p>

          <h2>II</h2>

          <p>
            At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not
            yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
            shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the
            fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he
            might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for,
            though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features
            which were associated with the two crimes which I have already
            recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of
            his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the
            nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was
            something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen,
            incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his
            system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he
            disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to
            his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had
            ceased to enter into my head.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
            groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
            disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to
            my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look
            three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod
            he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
            tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
            pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed
            heartily for some minutes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, really!&quot; he cried, and then he choked, and laughed
            again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
            chair.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
            employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
            habits, and, perhaps, the house, of Miss Irene Adler.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
            however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning
            in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful
            sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you
            will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It
            is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in the
            front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door.
            Large sitting room on the right side, well furnished, with long
            windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window
            fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing
            remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the
            top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely
            from every point of view, but without noting anything else of
            interest.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that
            there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
            garden. I lent the hostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and
            I received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills
            of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about
            Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the
            neighborhood, in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose
            biographies I was compelled to listen to.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And what of Irene Adler?&quot; I asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She
            is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
            Serpentine Mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
            drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.
            Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one
            male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and
            dashing; never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a
            Mr. Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a
            cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from
            Serpentine Mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all
            that they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge
            once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
            matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation
            between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she
            his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had
            probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,
            it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I
            should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
            gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
            widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
            details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you
            are to understand the situation.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I am following you closely,&quot; I answered.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab
            drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprung out. He was a
            remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and
            mustached&mdash;evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared
            to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed
            past the maid who opened the door, with the air of a man who was
            thoroughly at home.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
            glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room, pacing up and
            down, talking excitedly and waving his arms. Of her I could see
            nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
            before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his
            pocket and looked at it earnestly. 'Drive like the devil!' he
            shouted, 'first to Gross &amp; Hankey's in Regent Street, and then
            to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
            you do it in twenty minutes!'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not
            do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau,
            the coachman with his coat only half buttoned, and his tie under his
            ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the
            buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door
            and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she
            was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried; 'and half a
            sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
            whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
            landau, when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice
            at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. 'The
            Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it
            in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of
            course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but
            the others were there before us. The cab and landau with their
            steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the
            man, and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save
            the two whom I had followed, and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed
            to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a
            knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any
            other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise,
            the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came
            running as hard as he could toward me.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Thank God!' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'</p>

          <p>&quot;'What then?' I asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Come, man, come; only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I was half dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I
            was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my
            ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
            assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
            Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there
            was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the
            other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most
            preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and
            it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems
            that there had been some informality about their license; that the
            clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some
            sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having
            to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride
            gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in
            memory of the occasion.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,&quot; said I;
            &quot;and what then?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
            the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very
            prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door,
            however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to
            her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she
            said, as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different
            directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Which are?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Some cold beef and a glass of beer,&quot; he answered, ringing
            the bell. &quot;I have been too busy to think of food, and I am
            likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall
            want your cooperation.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I shall be delighted.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;You don't mind breaking the law?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Not in the least.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Nor running a chance of arrest?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Not in a good cause.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Oh, the cause is excellent!&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then I am your man.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I was sure that I might rely on you.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But what is it you wish?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear
            to you. Now,&quot; he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare
            that our landlady had provided, &quot;I must discuss it while I eat,
            for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we
            must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather,
            returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet
            her.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And what then?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
            occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not
            interfere, come what may. You understand?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I am to be neutral?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
            unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
            into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room
            window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open
            window.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;And when I raise my hand&mdash;so&mdash;you will throw into
            the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise
            the cry of fire. You quite follow me?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Entirely.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is nothing very formidable,&quot; he said, taking a long,
            cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. &quot;It is an ordinary plumber's
            smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end, to make it
            self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your
            cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You
            may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
            minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
            and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
            of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Precisely.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then you may entirely rely on me.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
            prepared for the new role I have to play.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in
            the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
            clergyman. His broad, black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie,
            his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent
            curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equaled. It
            was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his
            manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he
            assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute
            reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
            wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
            Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted
            as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the
            coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it
            from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description, but the locality
            appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a
            small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated.
            There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a
            corner, a scissors grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were
            flirting with a nurse girl, and several well-dressed young men who
            were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You see,&quot; remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in
            front of the house, &quot;this marriage rather simplifies matters.
            The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
            that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton
            as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the
            question is&mdash;where are we to find the photograph?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Where, indeed?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
            cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.
            She knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and
            searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may
            take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Where, then?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility.
            But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
            and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over
            to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could
            not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to
            bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to
            use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands
            upon it. It must be in her own house.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;But it has twice been burglarized.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Pshaw! They did not know how to look.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But how will you look?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I will not look.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;What then?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I will get her to show me.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But she will refuse.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It
            is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            As he spoke, the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round
            the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled
            up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up one of the loafing
            men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of
            earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer who had
            rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out which
            was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the
            loungers, and by the scissors grinder, who was equally hot upon the
            other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had
            stepped from her carriage, was the center of a little knot of
            struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists
            and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but,
            just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground,
            with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the
            guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in
            the other, while a number of better-dressed people who had watched
            the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady
            and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call
            her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top, with her
            superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back
            into the street.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Is the poor gentleman much hurt?&quot; she asked.</p>

          <p>&quot;He is dead,&quot; cried several voices.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;No, no, there's life in him,&quot; shouted another. &quot;But
            he'll be gone before you can get him to the hospital.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;He's a brave fellow,&quot; said a woman. &quot;They would have
            had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were
            a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah! he's breathing now.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Surely. Bring him into the sitting room. There is a
            comfortable sofa. This way, please.&quot; Slowly and solemnly he was
            borne into Briony Lodge, and laid out in the principal room, while I
            still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps
            had been lighted, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could
            see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was
            seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing,
            but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my
            life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
            conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
            the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to
            Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.
            I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.
            After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing
            her from injuring another.
          </p>

          <p>
            Holmes had sat upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
            is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window.
            At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I
            tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of &quot;Fire!&quot; The
            word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
            spectators, well dressed and ill&mdash;gentlemen, hostlers, and
            servant maids&mdash;joined in a general shriek of &quot;Fire!&quot;
            Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room, and out at the open
            window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
            the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false
            alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the
            corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
            friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He
            walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had
            turned down one of the quiet streets which led toward the Edgeware
            Road.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You did it very nicely, doctor,&quot; he remarked.
            &quot;Nothing could have been better. It is all right.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;You have the photograph?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I know where it is.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And how did you find out?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;She showed me, as I told you that she would.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I am still in the dark.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I do not wish to make a mystery,&quot; said he, laughing.
            &quot;The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that
            everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for
            the evening.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I guessed as much.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint
            in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
            to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old
            trick.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;That also I could fathom.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What
            else could she do? And into her sitting room, which was the very
            room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I
            was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
            air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
            chance.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;How did that help you?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
            fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values
            most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than
            once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington
            Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth
            Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby&mdash;an
            unmarried one reaches for her jewel box. Now it was clear to me that
            our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her
            than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm
            of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to
            shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is
            in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.
            She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she
            drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
            replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
            not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
            house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at
            once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me
            narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may
            ruin all.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And now?&quot; I asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the king
            to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
            shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady, but it is probable
            that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It
            might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own
            hands.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And when will you call?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
            have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
            may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
            the king without delay.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was
            searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Good night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
            greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
            hurried by.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I've heard that voice before,&quot; said Holmes, staring down
            the dimly lighted street. &quot;Now, I wonder who the deuce that
            could have been?&quot;
          </p>

          <hr style="width: 65%;" />
          <h2>III</h2>

          <p>
            I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
            toast and coffee in the morning, when the King of Bohemia rushed
            into the room.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You have really got it?&quot; he cried, grasping Sherlock
            Holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Not yet.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But you have hopes?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I have hopes.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then come. I am all impatience to be gone.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;We must have a cab.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No, my brougham is waiting.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then that will simplify matters.&quot; We descended, and
            started off once more for Briony Lodge.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Irene Adler is married,&quot; remarked Holmes.</p>

          <p>&quot;Married! When?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yesterday.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But to whom?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;To an English lawyer named Norton.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But she could not love him.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I am in hopes that she does.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And why in hopes?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Because it would spare your majesty all fear of future
            annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
            majesty. If she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why
            she should interfere with your majesty's plan.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is true. And yet&mdash;Well, I wish she had been of my own
            station. What a queen she would have made!&quot; He relapsed into a
            moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine
            Avenue.
          </p>

          <p>
            The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon
            the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
            brougham.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?&quot; said she.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I am Mr. Holmes,&quot; answered my companion, looking at her
            with a questioning and rather startled gaze.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
            left this morning, with her husband, by the 5:15 train from Charing
            Cross, for the Continent.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;What!&quot; Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin
            and surprise.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Do you mean that she has left England?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Never to return.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;And the papers?&quot; asked the king hoarsely. &quot;All is
            lost!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We shall see.&quot; He pushed past the servant, and rushed
            into the drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. The
            furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled
            shelves, and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked
            them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a
            small sliding shutter, and plunging in his hand, pulled out a
            photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself
            in evening dress; the letter was superscribed to &quot;Sherlock
            Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.&quot; My friend tore it
            open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of
            the preceding night, and ran in this way:
          </p>

          <div class="blockquot">
            <p>
              &quot;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,&mdash;You really did it very
              well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of the
              fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had
              betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you
              months ago. I had been told that if the king employed an agent, it
              would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet,
              with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even
              after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a
              dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an
              actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take
              advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the
              coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes,
              as I call them, and came down just as you departed.
            </p>

            <p>
              &quot;Well, I followed you to the door, and so made sure that I
              was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
              Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good night, and
              started for the Temple to see my husband.
            </p>

            <p>
              &quot;We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by
              so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
              you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
              peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The king may
              do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
              wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and preserve a weapon
              which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in
              the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess;
              and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours,
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            <span style="margin-left: 2em;"
              >&quot;IRENE NORTON, <i>n&eacute;e</i> ADLER.&quot;</span
            ><br />
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;What a woman&mdash;oh, what a woman!&quot; cried the King of
            Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. &quot;Did I not
            tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an
            admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my
            level?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;From what I have seen of the lady, she seems indeed to be on a
            very different level to your majesty,&quot; said Holmes coldly.
            &quot;I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your majesty's
            business to a more successful conclusion.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;On the contrary, my dear sir,&quot; cried the king,
            &quot;nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is
            inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the
            fire.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I am glad to hear your majesty say so.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
            reward you. This ring&mdash;&quot; He slipped an emerald snake ring
            from his finger, and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your majesty has something which I should value even more
            highly,&quot; said Holmes.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;You have but to name it.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;This photograph!&quot;</p>

          <p>The king stared at him in amazement.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Irene's photograph!&quot; he cried. &quot;Certainly, if you
            wish it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I thank your majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
            matter. I have the honor to wish you a very good morning.&quot; He
            bowed, and turning away without observing the hand which the king
            had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
          </p>

          <p>
            And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
            Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten
            by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of
            women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of
            Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under
            the honorable title of <i>the</i> woman.

          <h2><i>The Red-Headed League</i></h2>

          <p>
            I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
            autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very
            stout, florid-faced elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an
            apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes
            pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
            Watson,&quot; he said, cordially.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I was afraid that you were engaged.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;So I am. Very much so.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Then I can wait in the next room.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner
            and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt
            that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
            greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small,
            fat-encircled eyes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Try the settee,&quot; said Holmes, relapsing into his
            armchair, and putting his finger tips together, as was his custom
            when in judicial moods. &quot;I know, my dear Watson, that you share
            my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and
            humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it
            by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
            will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
            little adventures.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to
            me,&quot; I observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before
            we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary
            Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations
            we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any
            effort of the imagination.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
            view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you,
            until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledge me to be
            right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon
            me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one
            of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You
            have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are
            very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller
            crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt
            whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have
            heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an
            instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly
            among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr.
            Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your
            narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend, Dr. Watson, has
            not heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of
            the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your
            lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the
            course of events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other
            similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am
            forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief,
            unique.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
            little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
            inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement
            column, with his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out
            upon his knee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after
            the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be
            presented by his dress or appearance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
            bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman,
            obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd's check
            trousers, a not overclean black frock coat, unbuttoned in the front,
            and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square
            pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top hat
            and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a
            chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing
            remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the
            expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his
            head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. &quot;Beyond
            the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that
            he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China,
            and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can
            deduce nothing else.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon
            the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;How, in the name of good fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
            Holmes?&quot; he asked. &quot;How did you know, for example, that I
            did manual labor? It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
            carpenter.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size
            larger than your left. You have worked with it and the muscles are
            more developed.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read
            that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order,
            you use an arc and compass breastpin.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny
            for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
            elbow where you rest it upon the desk.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Well, but China?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;The fish which you have tattooed immediately above your wrist
            could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of
            tattoo marks, and have even contributed to the literature of the
            subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate
            pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese
            coin hanging from your watch chain, the matter becomes even more
            simple.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. &quot;Well, I never!&quot; said
            he. &quot;I thought at first that you had done something clever, but
            I see that there was nothing in it after all.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I begin to think, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;that I make
            a mistake in explaining. '<i>Omne ignotom pro magnifico</i>,' you
            know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer
            shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.
            Wilson?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, I have got it now,&quot; he answered, with his thick, red
            finger planted halfway down the column. &quot;Here it is. This is
            what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</p>

          <div class="blockquot">
            <p>
              &quot;To the Red-headed League: On account of the bequest of the
              late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now
              another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a
              salary of four pounds a week for purely nominal services. All
              red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of
              twenty-one years are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at
              eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
              Pope's Court, Fleet Street.&quot;
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            &quot;What on earth does this mean?&quot; I ejaculated, after I had
            twice read over the extraordinary announcement.
          </p>

          <p>
            Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
            high spirits. &quot;It is a little off the beaten track, isn't
            it?&quot; said he. &quot;And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch,
            and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which
            this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a
            note, doctor, of the paper and the date.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> of April 27, 1890. Just two
            months ago.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
            Holmes,&quot; said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead, &quot;I have
            a small pawnbroker's business at Saxe-Coburg Square, near the City.
            It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more
            than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two
            assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay
            him but that he is willing to come for half wages, so as to learn
            the business.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;What is the name of this obliging youth?&quot; asked Sherlock
            Holmes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth
            either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
            assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
            himself, and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all,
            if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who
            comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience
            among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not
            as remarkable as your advertisement.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, he has his faults, too,&quot; said Mr. Wilson. &quot;Never
            was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when
            he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the
            cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is
            his main fault; but, on the whole, he's a good worker. There's no
            vice in him.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;He is still with you, I presume?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
            cooking, and keeps the place clean&mdash;that's all I have in the
            house, for I am a widower, and never had any family. We live very
            quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads,
            and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
            Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks,
            with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Why that?' I asks.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
            Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
            gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there
            are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with
            the money. If my hair would only change color here's a nice little
            crib all ready for me to step into.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
            very stay-at-home man, and, as my business came to me instead of my
            having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot
            over the door mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going
            on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
            asked, with his eyes open.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Never.'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
            of the vacancies.'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'And what are they worth?' I asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is
            slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other
            occupations.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
            for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra
            couple of hundred would have been very handy.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Tell me all about it,' said I.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see
            for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
            where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
            the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins,
            who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he
            had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it
            was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of
            trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing
            of easy berths to men whose hair is of that color. From all I hear
            it is splendid pay, and very little to do.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
            would apply.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
            really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
            started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old
            town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is of no use your
            applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
            real, bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
            Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth
            your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few
            hundred pounds.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Now it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
            that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to
            me that, if there was to be any competition in the matter, I stood
            as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding
            seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove
            useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day,
            and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a
            holiday, so we shut the business up, and started off for the address
            that was given us in the advertisement.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes.
            From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red
            in his hair had tramped into the City to answer the advertisement.
            Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
            looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
            there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by
            that single advertisement. Every shade of color they
            were&mdash;straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish setter, liver, clay;
            but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid
            flame-colored tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have
            given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he
            did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted
            until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which
            led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some
            going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as
            well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Your experience has been a most entertaining one,&quot;
            remarked Holmes, as his client paused and refreshed his memory with
            a huge pinch of snuff. &quot;Pray continue your very interesting
            statement.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
            and a deal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was
            even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he
            came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which
            would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a
            very easy matter after all. However, when our turn came, the little
            man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he
            closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word
            with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
            willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He
            has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
            fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
            gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
            plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
            success.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
            however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
            With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
            yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he, as he
            released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to
            be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by
            paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust
            you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted
            through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A
            groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped
            away in different directions, until there was not a red head to be
            seen except my own and that of the manager.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one
            of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
            you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;I answered that I had not.</p>

          <p>&quot;His face fell immediately.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Dear me!' he said, gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I
            am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
            propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their
            maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
            bachelor.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I
            was not to have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over
            for a few minutes, he said that it would be all right.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
            fatal, but we must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a
            head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new
            duties?'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
            said I.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent
            Spaulding. 'I shall be able to look after that for you.'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'What would be the hours?' I asked.</p>

          <p>&quot;'Ten to two.'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
            Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evenings, which is just
            before pay day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
            the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and
            that he would see to anything that turned up.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'</p>

          <p>&quot;'Is four pounds a week.'</p>

          <p>&quot;'And the work?'</p>

          <p>&quot;'Is purely nominal.'</p>

          <p>&quot;'What do you call purely nominal?'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
            building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
            position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't
            comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that
            time.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of
            leaving,' said I.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross, 'neither
            sickness, nor business, nor anything else. There you must stay, or
            you lose your billet.'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'And the work?'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Is to copy out the &quot;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.&quot;
            There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your
            own ink, pens, and blotting paper, but we provide this table and
            chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Certainly,' I answered.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Then, good-by, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
            once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
            enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with
            my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at
            my own good fortune.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was
            in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
            whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
            object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
            belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
            such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
            'Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could
            to cheer me up, but by bed time I had reasoned myself out of the
            whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at
            it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill pen
            and seven sheets of foolscap paper I started off for Pope's Court.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, to my surprise and delight everything was as right as
            possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
            was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon
            the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to
            time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me
            good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and
            locked the door of the office after me.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
            manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
            week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after.
            Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two.
            By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning,
            and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course,
            I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure
            when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited
            me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
            Abbots, and Archery, and Armor, and Architecture, and Attica, and
            hoped with diligence that I might get on to the Bs before very long.
            It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a
            shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to
            an end.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;To an end?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
            usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
            little square of cardboard hammered onto the middle of the panel
            with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            He held up a piece of white cardboard, about the size of a sheet of
            note paper. It read in this fashion:
          </p>

          <p>
            <span style="margin-left: 2em;"
              >&quot;THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.</span
            ><br />
            <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oct. 9, 1890.&quot;</span><br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
            face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
            overtopped every consideration that we both burst out into a roar of
            laughter.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I cannot see that there is anything very funny,&quot; cried
            our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. &quot;If
            you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go
            elsewhere.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;No, no,&quot; cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair
            from which he had half risen. &quot;I really wouldn't miss your case
            for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
            will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
            Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
            door?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
            at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about
            it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on
            the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had
            become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of
            any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered
            that the name was new to him.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Well' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'</p>

          <p>&quot;'What, the red-headed man?'</p>

          <p>&quot;'Yes.'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a
            solicitor, and was using my room as a temporary convenience until
            his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
          </p>

          <p>&quot;'Where could I find him?'</p>

          <p>
            &quot;'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
            King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it
            was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
            heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And what did you do then?&quot; asked Holmes.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
            assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
            that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good
            enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a
            struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give
            advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to
            you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And you did very wisely,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;Your case is
            an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
            From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver
            issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Grave enough!&quot; said Mr. Jabez Wilson. &quot;Why, I have
            lost four pound a week.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;As far as you are personally concerned,&quot; remarked Holmes,
            &quot;I do not see that you have any grievance against this
            extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand,
            richer by some thirty pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge
            which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter
            A. You have lost nothing by them.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
            and what their object was in playing this prank&mdash;if it was a
            prank&mdash;upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
            cost them two-and-thirty pounds.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And,
            first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
            first called your attention to the advertisement&mdash;how long had
            he been with you?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;About a month then.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;How did he come?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;In answer to an advertisement.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Was he the only applicant?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;No, I had a dozen.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Why did you pick him?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Because he was handy and would come cheap.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;At half wages, in fact.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his
            face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid
            upon his forehead.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. &quot;I
            thought as much,&quot; said he. &quot;Have you ever observed that
            his ears are pierced for earrings?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he
            was a lad.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Hum!&quot; said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. &quot;He
            is still with you?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;And has your business been attended to in your absence?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of
            a morning.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
            opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
            Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a
            conclusion.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, Watson,&quot; said Holmes, when our visitor had left us,
            &quot;what do you make of it all?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I make nothing of it,&quot; I answered frankly. &quot;It is a
            most mysterious business.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;As a rule,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;the more bizarre a thing
            is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace,
            featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace
            face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over
            this matter.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;What are you going to do, then?&quot; I asked.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;To smoke,&quot; he answered. &quot;It is quite a three-pipe
            problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty
            minutes.&quot; He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin
            knees drawn up to his hawklike nose, and there he sat with his eyes
            closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some
            strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped
            asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out
            of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind, and
            put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Sarasate plays at St. James's Hall this afternoon,&quot; he
            remarked. &quot;What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
            you for a few hours?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
            absorbing.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
            first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there
            is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather
            more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I
            want to introspect. Come along!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            We traveled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
            walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story
            which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little,
            shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy, two-storied brick
            houses looked out into a small railed-in inclosure, where a lawn of
            weedy grass, and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard
            fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt
            balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters, upon a
            corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client
            carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with
            his head on one side, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining
            brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street,
            and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the
            houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's and, having thumped
            vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he
            went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
            bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Holmes, &quot;I only wished to ask you
            how you would go from here to the Strand.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Third right, fourth left,&quot; answered the assistant,
            promptly, closing the door.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Smart fellow, that,&quot; observed Holmes as we walked away.
            &quot;He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and
            for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have
            known something of him before.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Evidently,&quot; said I, &quot;Mr. Wilson's assistant counts
            for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure
            that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see
            him.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Not him.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;What then?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;The knees of his trousers.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And what did you see?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;What I expected to see.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Why did you beat the pavement?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.
            We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
            Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner
            from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to
            it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the
            main arteries which convey the traffic of the City to the north and
            west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce
            flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths
            were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult
            to realize, as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately
            business premises, that they really abutted on the other side upon
            the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Let me see,&quot; said Holmes, standing at the corner, and
            glancing along the line, &quot;I should like just to remember the
            order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact
            knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist; the
            little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban
            Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
            depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, doctor,
            we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a
            cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness,
            and delicacy, and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to
            vex us with their conundrums.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
            very capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the
            afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
            happiness, gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music,
            while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as
            unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless,
            keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to
            conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately
            asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness
            represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the
            poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in
            him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to
            devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly
            formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his
            armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then
            it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and
            that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of
            intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would
            look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of
            other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the
            music at St. James's Hall, I felt that an evil time might be coming
            upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You want to go home, no doubt, doctor,&quot; he remarked, as
            we emerged.
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Yes, it would be as well.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;And I have some business to do which will take some hours.
            This business at Saxe-Coburg Square is serious.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Why serious?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason
            to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
            Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
            to-night.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;At what time?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Ten will be early enough.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I shall be at Baker Street at ten.&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Very well. And, I say, doctor! there may be some little
            danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.&quot; He
            waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant
            among the crowd.
          </p>

          <p>
            I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always
            oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with
            Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what
            he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw
            clearly not only what had happened, but what was about to happen,
            while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As
            I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from
            the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the
            &quot;Encyclop&aelig;dia&quot; down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
            Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What
            was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were
            we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that
            this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable
            man&mdash;a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it
            out, but gave it up in despair, and set the matter aside until night
            should bring an explanation.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way
            across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two
            hansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I
            heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found
            Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I
            recognized as Peter Jones, the official police agent; while the
            other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and
            oppressively respectable frock coat.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Ha! our party is complete,&quot; said Holmes, buttoning up his
            pea-jacket, and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
            &quot;Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
            introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
            to-night's adventure.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We're hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,&quot; said
            Jones, in his consequential way. &quot;Our friend here is a
            wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to
            help him do the running down.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our
            chase,&quot; observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes,
            sir,&quot; said the police agent loftily. &quot;He has his own
            little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a
            little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a
            detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as
            in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has
            been more nearly correct than the official force.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right!&quot; said the
            stranger, with deference. &quot;Still, I confess that I miss my
            rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years
            that I have not had my rubber.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I think you will find,&quot; said Sherlock Holmes, &quot;that
            you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done
            yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr.
            Merryweather, the stake will be some thirty thousand pounds; and for
            you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your
            hands.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
            young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
            profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any
            criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His
            grandfather was a Royal Duke, and he himself has been to Eton and
            Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet
            signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man
            himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising
            money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his
            track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you
            to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay,
            and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
            past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will
            take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,
            and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
            afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit streets
            until we emerged into Farringdon Street.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We are close there now,&quot; my friend remarked. &quot;This
            fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in
            the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
            not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He
            has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog, and as
            tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
            are, and they are waiting for us.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
            ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and following the
            guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage, and
            through a side door which he opened for us. Within there was a small
            corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was
            opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which
            terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to
            light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling
            passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or
            cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You are not very vulnerable from above,&quot; Holmes remarked,
            as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Nor from below,&quot; said Mr. Merryweather, striking his
            stick upon the flags which lined the floor. &quot;Why, dear me, it
            sounds quite hollow!&quot; he remarked, looking up in surprise.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,&quot; said
            Holmes severely. &quot;You have already imperiled the whole success
            of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to
            sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
            very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
            knees upon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
            began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
            seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again,
            and put his glass in his pocket.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;We have at least an hour before us,&quot; he remarked,
            &quot;for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker
            is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner
            they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape.
            We are at present, doctor&mdash;as no doubt you have
            divined&mdash;in the cellar of the City branch of one of the
            principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of
            directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the
            more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest
            in this cellar at present.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It is our French gold,&quot; whispered the director. &quot;We
            have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon
            it.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Your French gold?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our
            resources, and borrowed, for that purpose, thirty thousand napoleons
            from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had
            occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our
            cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains two thousand napoleons
            packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much
            larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office,
            and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;Which were very well justified,&quot; observed Holmes.</p>

          <p>
            &quot;And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect
            that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime,
            Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark
            lantern.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;And sit in the dark?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket,
            and I thought that, as we were a <i>partie carr&eacute;e</i>, you
            might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's
            preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a
            light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are
            daring men, and, though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they
            may do us some harm, unless we are careful. I shall stand behind
            this crate, and do you conceal yourself behind those. Then, when I
            flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson,
            have no compunction about shooting them down.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
            which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his
            lantern, and left us in pitch darkness&mdash;such an absolute
            darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal
            remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash
            out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch
            of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the
            sudden gloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;They have but one retreat,&quot; whispered Holmes. &quot;That
            is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you
            have done what I asked you, Jones?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front
            door.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
            and wait.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards, it was but
            an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
            have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were
            weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position, yet my nerves
            were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was
            so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my
            companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier inbreath of
            the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.
            From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the
            floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.
          </p>

          <p>
            At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it
            lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any
            warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a
            white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the center of the
            little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its
            writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn
            as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single
            lurid spark, which marked a chink between the stones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
            tearing sound, one of the broad white stones turned over upon its
            side, and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the
            light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish
            face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either
            side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high,
            until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at
            the side of the hole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe
            and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red
            hair.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It's all clear,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Have you the chisel
            and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for
            it!&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
            collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
            rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
            upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes's hunting crop came down
            on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It's no use, John Clay,&quot; said Holmes blandly, &quot;you
            have no chance at all.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;So I see,&quot; the other answered, with the utmost coolness.
            &quot;I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got
            his coat-tails.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;There are three men waiting for him at the door,&quot; said
            Holmes.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Oh, indeed. You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
            must compliment you.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And I you,&quot; Holmes answered. &quot;Your red-headed idea
            was very new and effective.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You'll see your pal again presently,&quot; said Jones.
            &quot;He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out
            while I fix the derbies.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,&quot;
            remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
            &quot;You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
            the goodness also, when you address me, always to say 'sir' and
            'please.'&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;All right,&quot; said Jones, with a stare and a snigger.
            &quot;Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs where we can get a
            cab to carry your highness to the police station?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;That is better,&quot; said John Clay serenely. He made a
            sweeping bow to the three of us, and walked quietly off in the
            custody of the detective.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Really, Mr. Holmes,&quot; said Mr. Merryweather, as we
            followed them from the cellar, &quot;I do not know how the bank can
            thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and
            defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined
            attempts at bank robbery, that have ever come within my
            experience.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with
            Mr. John Clay,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;I have been at some small
            expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund,
            but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which
            is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative
            of the Red-headed League.&quot;
          </p>

          <hr style="width: 45%;" />

          <p>
            &quot;You see, Watson,&quot; he explained, in the early hours of the
            morning, as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street,
            &quot;it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
            object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the
            League, and the copying of the 'Encyclop&aelig;dia,' must be to get
            this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours
            every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but really it would
            be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested
            to Clay's ingenious mind by the color of his accomplice's hair. The
            four pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it
            to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the
            advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue
            incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure
            his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of
            the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that
            he had some strong motive for securing the situation.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>&quot;But how could you guess what the motive was?&quot;</p>

          <p>
            &quot;Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
            mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
            man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house
            which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an
            expenditure as they were at. It must then be something out of the
            house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for
            photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar!
            There was the end of this tangled clew. Then I made inquiries as to
            this mysterious assistant, and found that I had to deal with one of
            the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing
            something in the cellar&mdash;something which took many hours a day
            for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of
            nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
            surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
            ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It
            was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
            assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never
            set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His
            knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how
            worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of
            burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing
            for. I walked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank
            abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my
            problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon
            Scotland Yard, and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the
            result that you have seen.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
            to-night?&quot; I asked.
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign
            that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence; in
            other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was
            essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered,
            or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better
            than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
            For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;You reasoned it out beautifully,&quot; I exclaimed, in
            unfeigned admiration. &quot;It is so long a chain, and yet every
            link rings true.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;It saved me from ennui,&quot; he answered, yawning.
            &quot;Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent
            in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
            These little problems help me to do so.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &quot;And you are a benefactor of the race,&quot; said I. He
            shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
            some little use,&quot; he remarked. &quot;'L'homme c'est
            rien&mdash;l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to
            Georges Sands.&quot;
