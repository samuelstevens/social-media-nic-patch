            Short stories are some of the most approachable literature authors
            have ever provided. They introduce characters quickly, keep you on

            In addition, there's less commitment from you as a reader to sit
            down and handle a 400-page novel. You can get the entire message of
            a short story in one sitting, and feel accomplished without
            dedicating hours to a story.
