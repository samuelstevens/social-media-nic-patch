            Typically, writing it by hand is better than typing, but we're not
            here to be perfect. We're here to be just a little bit better than
            before. So typing will do.

            It's going to be weird to go to a site to consume some content and
            then end up writing, but this is healthy and helpful and
            <em>puts you first</em>.

            This will get easier over time. If you like it, I encourage you to

            One of the main strengths of journaling is that it's private. Nobody
            else will read what you write, so you can write whatever you want.
            Here, I'm asking you to write it on the internet, a place so
            notoriosly <strong>un</strong>-private that [add a metaphor here].
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            I understand your concern. I really do. I don't record what's
            written here. There's not even a button to submit the journal. I do
            not want to invade your privacy. I also know it's not that easy to
            believe me.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            But journaling is really good for you, and I would hate for you to
            miss out on this activity because of privacy. So open up your
            favorite notes app. Open up a physical journal, if you have one.
            Write it somewhere, just <strong>write</strong>.
