            Look, this is the hard one. If you're only going to not have
            anything to do for less than a minute, then just sit there. It's not
            that long, and it's not that hard, but it helps your attention span
            to <em>just be bored</em> for periods of time.
          </p>

          <p class="main-text">Some things to do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Close your eyes and think about how you physically feel.</li>
            <li>Look at a wall. Imagine some fancy shapes in there.</li>
            <li>Doodle on some paper.</li>
            <li>Sit there and just sit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="main-text">
            This will get easier over time. Honestly, if you're read this far,
            you might be done waiting for whatever it is you're waiting. Not looking at a new Instagram photo or a Facebook post is going to make a real change in your ability to focus on one thing for a longer period of time.
