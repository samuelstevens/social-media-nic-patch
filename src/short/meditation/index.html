            Meditating is awesome. Everyone says it, nobody does it, it's always
            something that you know you <em>should</em> do. Well, you have a
            couple minutes with nothing to do. Let's give it a shot.

            mind. If we're all so concerned with running and swimming and
            exercising my muscles and heart and all that, then shouldn't I do

            It's simple, it's free, it's immediate. Let's try it out, and see if
            it treats us better than

            If you've never meditated before, it can be hard to start. I've
            provided a very basic meditation "app" here with some basic prompts,
            but there are more resources at the bottom of the

            I personally use <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>,

            $10 a year. There are dozens of other good resources out there, and
            I invite you to take a look for yourself.
