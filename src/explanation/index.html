            I'm a student who spends all of my time on Reddit. Any free second I
            have, I'm browsing <strong>r/all</strong> to see what's happening,
            desperately trying to not be bored.

            It's becoming (already is) a real issue for me, and I know it
            affects some of the people around me. And while Reddit is my digital
            vice, for some people it's Facebook. For others it's Clash of Clans.

            In the past, we weren't concerned about smoking. How can it harm you? It seemed foolish to believe that it was anything malicious, that tobacco companies <em>of course</em> had your health as one of their priorities.
